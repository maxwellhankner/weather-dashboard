# Weather Dashboard
## Welcome to Maxwell Hankner's Weather Dashboard Project
Find out what the weather is looking like by searching a city. 

## Features
This project features an api call to openweathermap.org and retrieves the weather information requested by the user. Any city the user has entered is added to the bank. All locations are even saved in local memory so the user can close the tab and come back later. The information displayed to the user is layed out in an easy to understand way and there is a solid amount of information for them to view. If the user desires, they can even clear the whole location bank and start from scratch. 

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was getting the api calls to fire properly. Another challenge was going through the code base and really understanding exaclty what was going on before I could implement my own feature.

## Not Included
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to spend much time on this project, so I just threw in a pretty lousy feature (not going to deny that). But, if I had more time, I would turn this application into a pwa and replace my mobile weather application that I use currently. I would give it a nice dark theme and probably use it all the time like I do with my existing app. 

### Thanks for checking out this project!
